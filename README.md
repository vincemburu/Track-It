# Project Title: Track It

#### Description:

In this project, I present to you Track It, a simple web application that lets you track your money expenditure by taking in your income as well as your expense and presents the data in a pie chart.

## Introduction
* Index Page:
  For the index page, you will find a table layout where the user infomation will be presented after inputting the data at the add page.

* Add Page:
  In the add page, there will be a form page which the user will be required to fill out. The form includes an input field of Amount, where the user will input the amount of money they want to be generated. It will also include a Type section which the user can choose between Income and Expense. Lastly there will be a Category section where the user can choose between salary, rent, investment and side-hustle.

* I've used Flask web framework based in Python, necessary for flask-sqlalchemy to manage SQL database with sqlite and flask-wtf to upload files and forms extensions
